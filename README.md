# cg
Compare to hygen, yo. What I need 
1. template is runnable as normal project. 
2. instinct command with folder structure.
3. quick generate tempalte from project.
4. support prompt and args replacement.

# API Design
``` bash
cg js react hello_world
```
will copy $CG_TEMPLATE_FODLER/js/react/  to local folder hello_world. Nothing fancy
